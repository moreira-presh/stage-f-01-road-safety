## Problem Statement  
1. Are there patterns for accidents involving different road users?
2. Can we predict the safest / most dangerous times to travel
3. Can this data help route cyclists around accident hotspots taking into account the time of day, weather, route etc
4. Are certain cars more accident prone than others?
